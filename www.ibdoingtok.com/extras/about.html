        <p class="generic-text-middle">Why Do I Ask to Disable the Adblocker?</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="generic-text-small">As a university student, I need to pay for my tuition, I hope to earn a small amount of income on the side so it would be very much appreciated if you could turn off any adblocking extensions. If this project is not profitable, then I might have to consider forcing people to turn off their adblocker â˜¹. So plz help a uni student out.</p>
